	 ========================
	 Properties class In Java
	 ========================
	 -> Properties is a predefined class available in java.util.package
	 -> Properties class extending properties from HashTable class
	 -> Properties class is used to avoid hardcoding in the project
	 
	 -> Hardcoding means fixing values in the program(ex: database properties)
	 
	 =======
	 Use case
	 =======
	 -> If java application wants to communicate the database, then we need to use database credentials in java program
	 -> If we hardcode database credentials in java program then project maintenance will become difficult
	    Why because in future if database credentials modified then we need to modify our java program also.
	    if java program is modified then we need to recompile and re execute our program/project.
	    
	    
	    => To overcame above properties we should not do hardcoding
	    => To avoid hard coding in java 
	 
      
      -> properties file contains data in key-value format
