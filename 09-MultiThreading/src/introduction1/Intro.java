1. The ways to define a thread ?
There are two ways
     1 > By extending Thread class
     2 > By implementing Runnable(interface)



2. Multi tasking executing several tasks simultaneously is the concept of multi tasking
  There are two types of multi tasking
  
    1> Process based multi tasking.
    
    2> Thread based multi tasking.
    
  ** 1 Process based multi tasking : executing several tasks simultaneously where each task is a separate 
   independent program is called  Process based multi tasking.
   
   eg : while typing a java program in the eclipse we can listen audio from the same system.
   at the same time we can download a file from Internet all this tasks executed 
   simultaneously and independent of each other hence it is Process based multi tasking.
   
   Process based multi tasking is best suitable at Os (operating system) level
   
  **  2 Thread based multi tasking : executing several tasks simultaneously each task is
         a separate independent part of the same program is called Thread based multi tasking
         and each independent part is thread.
         
         Thread based multi tasking is suitable for programmatic level
         
         
         Weather it is a process based or thread based the main objective of multi tasking is
         to reduce response time of the system and to improve performance.
         
          
    ------> The main important application area of multi threading are 
     
             1. To develop multi media graphics
             2. To develop Animations 
             3. To develop video games
             4. To develop web servers and application servers etc.
